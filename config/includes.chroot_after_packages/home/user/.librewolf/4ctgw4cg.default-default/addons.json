All that tracking code is not necessary for a website to be displayed or work correctly and can therefore be removed—that is exactly what ClearURLs does.\n\nAnother common example are Amazon URLs. If you search for a product on Amazon you will see a very long URL, such as: https://www.amazon.com/dp/exampleProduct/ref=sxin_0_pb?__mk_de_DE=ÅMÅŽÕÑ&keywords=tea&pd_rd_i=exampleProduct&pd_rd_r=8d39e4cd-1e4f-43db-b6e7-72e969a84aa5&pd_rd_w=1pcKM&pd_rd_wg=hYrNl&pf_rd_p=50bbfd25-5ef7-41a2-68d6-74d854b30e30&pf_rd_r=0GMWD0YYKA7XFGX55ADP&qid=1517757263&rnid=2914120011\n\nIndeed most of the above URL is tracking code. Once ClearURLs has cleaned the address, it will look like this:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/exampleProduct\n\nWhy use this extension as opposed to similar ones?\nMost other “link cleaners” employ about a dozen rules when looking for tracking parameters to remove. ClearURLs utilizes over 250 rules, so its capabilities are more comprehensive.\nAnd ClearURLs is open source, so everyone can join in to the project and/or can check the source code to error or malicious code.\n\nAll functions in a nutshell\n\n    Removes tracking from URLs automatically in the background\n    Blocks some common ad domains (optional)\n    Has a built-in tool to clean up multiple URLs at once\n    Supports redirection to the destination, without tracking services as middleman\n    Adds an entry to the context menu so that links can be copied quickly and cleanly\n    Blocks hyperlink auditing, also known as ping tracking\n    Prevents tracking injection over history API\n    Prevents Google from rewriting the search results (to include tracking elements)\n    Prevents Yandex from rewriting the search results (to include tracking elements)\n\n\nWhat do we collect?\nThis extension protects and respects your privacy.

It has never been sold and never will.\n\nWHAT IS IT?\nFoxyProxy is a Firefox and Chrome extension that switches an internet connection across one or more proxy servers. Proxies can be switched by:\n\n1. point-and-click of colored icons in a popup menu\n2. URL - define URL patterns with wildcards or regular expressions\n3. browser tab - set individual proxies per tab!\n4. Firefox container or Private Browsing windows - define different proxies for each container\n\nSOME FEATURES\n\n    Automatically switch proxy by: browser tab, URL patterns, firefox container, private browsing window, or manually select from a drop-down list\n    Customize colors and country flags to make it easy to see which proxy is in use\n    Import/Export all of your settings, or just URL patterns, to share with others. Optionally synchronize proxy settings with your other Firefox instances when you use Firefox Sync.\n    Keyboard shortcuts to quickly switch proxies and perform other actions\n    Turn WebRTC on/off to further limit discovery of your IP address\n    Quick-Add to quickly add new URL patterns to proxy settings\n    Globally exclude any website from all proxying\n    Built-in pattern tester to test and debug your URL patterns\n    Advanced logging shows you which proxies were used and when so you can debug problems\n    Extensive built-in help\n\n\nPERMISSIONS\n\n    downloads: Required to export the extension settings to a file. Users can import that file to other Chrome/Firefox instances, or share it with colleagues, in order to keep the same settings. It can also be backed up and used later.\n    proxy: The core function of the extension is to allow users to set the proxy server used by the browser.\n    storage: Required to store proxy server settings (hostname, port, username, and which proxy server is enabled by the user)\n    tabs: Required so that users can set separate proxies to use per tab. It is also needed for \"QuickAdd\" to quickly add a URL pattern that applies to the current/active tab. It is also used to open a URL to getfoxyproxy.org where there is online help.\n    webRequest: Required to authenticate with proxy servers via webRequest.onAuthRequired\n    webRequestAuthProvider: Required to authenticate with proxies servers via webRequest.onAuthRequired\n    browsingData: Required so the extension can delete cookies, indexedDB, and localStorage when requested by the user on the Options page (*Delete Browsing Data* button)\n    privacy: Required so the extension can call browser.privacy.network.webRTCIPHandlingPolicy to turn on/off webRTC in Chrome (*Limit WebRTC* checkbox in Options page)\n    host permission: Required to proxy all webRequests and provide proxy server authentication. all_urls is used because users may choose to load any/all URLs through proxy servers (chrome.webRequest.onAuthRequired and chrome.webRequest.onAuthRequired.addListener) . Required to proxy all webRequests and provide proxy server authentication. Also needed to get accounts details from FoxyProxy servers, if requested by the user with the Import FoxyProxy Account on the Import tab.\n\n\nNo remote code is used in this extension.\n\nWhy is there a crypto library in this extension?\nThe crypto library is needed to migrate encrypted settings from an old version to version 8.x and above.

You can easily set custom \"user-agent\" strings from the toolbar popup\n2. The extension uses a two-factor technique to mimic your default \"user-agent\" string, which is the most reliable method\n3. The extension does not use any resources when it is not spoofing the user-agent\n4. The extension enables user-agent spoofing on specific domains only; it is conversely possible to exclude certain domains from spoofing. Check the Options page for more info.\n5. You can set per-site user-agent strings\n6. There is an option to randomize user-agent strings.\n7. It is possible to set user-agent string for a single window; you can have a separate user-agent string for each browser window\n\nSupported operating systems:\nWindows, Mac OS, Linux, Chromium OS, Ubuntu, Debian, Android, iOS, AmigaOS, OpenBSD, BeOS, Haiku, Solaris, NetBSD, FreeBSD, Slackware, SUSE, gentoo, Fedora, Gentoo, Mageia, CentOS, Mint, DragonFly, Kubuntu, Mandriva, Zenwalk, Unix, GNU, OS/2, AIX, QNX, BEOS, RISC OS, Symbian, Nintendo, OpenSolaris, Kubuntu\n\nSupported browsers:\nInternet Explorer, Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Edge, WebKit, Avant, Maxthon, Arora, Mozilla, Epiphany, Camino, Chimera, Chromium, Dragon, conkeror, Conkeror, Dillo, Links, Firebird, Swiftfox, Netscape, Flock, iCab, Iceape, icecat, IceCat, IceWeasel, Iron, Meleon, Konqueror, Lunascape, Lynx, MAXTHON, midori, Midori, KHTML, Mosaic, NetSurf, OmniWeb, Tablet, Mini, Phoenix, RockMelt, Safari, Browser, SeaMonkey, Slim, Webkit, w3m\n\nFor more info and general bug reports please use:\nhttps://add0n.com/useragent-switcher.html\n\nFor technical bug reports please use:\nhttps://github.com/ray-lothian/UserAgent-Switcher/","weeklyDownloads":6445,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Ray","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/13129494/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/188/188200.png?modified=1622132777","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/188/188200.jpg?modified=1622132777","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":334},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/202/202435.png?modified=1622132779","width":440,"height":280,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/202/202435.jpg?modified=1622132779","thumbnailWidth":440,"thumbnailHeight":280}],"contributionURL":"https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/addondev/10usd?country.x=USD&utm_content=product-page-contribute&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=addons.mozilla.org","averageRating":4.154,"reviewCount":262,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/user-agent-string-switcher/reviews/","updateDate":1682502684000},{"id":"CanvasBlocker@kkapsner.de","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/534/534930-32.png?modified=1581849561","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/534/534930-64.png?modified=1581849561","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/534/534930-128.png?modified=1581849561"},"name":"CanvasBlocker","version":"1.11","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4413485/canvasblocker-1.11.xpi","homepageURL":"https://github.com/kkapsner/CanvasBlocker/","supportURL":null,"amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/canvasblocker/","description":"Alters some JS APIs to prevent fingerprinting.","fullDescription":"This add-on allows users to prevent websites from using some Javascript APIs to fingerprint them.
